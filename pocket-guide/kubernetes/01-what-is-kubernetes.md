**Traditional deployment era**:

- Resource allocation issues
- Not scalable
- High maintenance cost of physical servers

**Virtualized deployment era**:

- Multiple Virtual Machine (VMs) on a single physical server's CPU
- Isolation between VMs (Provide a level of security)
- Better utilization of resources
- Better scalability
- Reduce hardware costs

**Container deployment era**:

- Operating System (OS) sharing
- lightweight
- Portable

Benefits:

- Agile application creation and deployment
- Continuous development, integration and deployment
- Dev and Ops separation of concerns
- Environmental consistency
- Cloud and OS distribution portability
- Application-centric management
- Loosely coupled, distributed, elastic, liberated micro-services
- Resource isolation
- Resource utilization

## Why you need Kubernetes and what can it do

Kubernetes provides you with:

- Service discovery and load balancing
- Storage orchestration
- Automated rollouts and rollbacks
- Automatic bin packing
- Self-healing
- Secret and configuration management
