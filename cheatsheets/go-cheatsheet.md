# Go Cheat Sheet

My most common `go` command

```sh
go build # compile packages and dependencies
go run # compile and run Go program
go fmt # gofmt (reformat) package sources
go install # compile and install packages and dependencies
go get # add dependencies to current module and install them
go test # test packages
```
